# 🎬 reelnn - A Self-Hosted Streaming Web App Using Telegram

**reelnn** (**reel-inn**) is a self-hosted media web app that allows users to **stream and manage their personally owned videos** directly from Telegram. Built with Next.js for the frontend and Python for the backend, it uses Telegram as a storage backend — removing the need for traditional video hosting services.

> ⚠️ **Important:** This tool is designed **only for legal, personal use**. It does not host or provide any copyrighted content.
